# PythonFlaskConnexion
This is the sample application developed using python flask, connection framework as per my understanding and with the help of some sample applications, i found.
this is to list out the tasks from the file and to search, create and delete a task.
how to run it.
- make sure python is installed and the path is already set in the machine.
- go to the parent directory and install modules Flask, Connection and Connection[swagger] using "pip install <module_name>"
- run the server.py file the server will be started
- using localhost:5000, can go to the home page of the app.

What are missing in this:
- No tests included
- No coverage tools added
- No Database included
- All the functionality is not covered
- No documentation
